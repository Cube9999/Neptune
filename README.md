## How to build
Neptune uses CMake as it's build system. Which makes building very simple. You can build with these commands:

```
    mkdir bin
    ./gen_cache
    cd bin
    ninja
```

You can change gen_cache to use whatever generator you'd like. Or to modify/add any CMake cache options.

## Requirements


If you wish to compile this yourself, you'll need these requirements:


  - a C++17 compiler (clang++ recommended)
  - cmake
  - ninja or make (ninja recommended)
  
**NOTE:** *if you do not have these requirements, NVM might not work properly!*
